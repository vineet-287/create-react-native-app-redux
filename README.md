This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

[Read WIKI] (https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)

## How to use

This project cum architecture is just a combination of `create-react-native-app` & `redux`. Just follow below steps and you're done


```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vineet-287/create-react-native-app-redux.git
$ npm install
$ npm run
$ Scan QR code
$ Enjoy
```


You will be getting a login screen at very first. Just hit any login with password you will get success alert.
To check more in the code just got `projectRootFolder/src/client/Services/Actions/Login.js` and uncomment line 8 - 12. 
It will dispatch an error which may be login error. Just below you can get `axios` example which demonstrate API calling
and handling data.

## Support and Contact

Open new ticket to get some help. For future updates, I will try to implement another good architecture for general uses.
